// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis = `In this stage the plans from the previous step are compared with what needs to happen, this includes buisiness requirements and potential risks.`
const Design = `In design, typicall a protoype model is made, and once a succesful layout is made the source code begins to be written.`
const Implementation = `Implimentation is when the previous design is implimented into the neccesary program.`
const Testing = `Testing is when the design is checked over after implimentation, in this stage most of the inital bugs are fixed and neccary changes are made.`
const Maintain = `Maintinence happens when the testing phase is succesful and works as intended, this stage is contiuous as changes are made and the program is built uppon, this includes bug fixes, optimization, and any buisiness changes.`
